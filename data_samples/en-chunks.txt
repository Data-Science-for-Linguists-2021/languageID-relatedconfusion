opment Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism Under the DSM autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities These deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use

ic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turntaking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things Three to fiveyearold autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others However they do form attachments to their primary caregivers Most autistic children display

il Bakunin Brian Morriss argues that it is conceptually and historically misleading to create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism History Premodern era During the prehistoric era of mankind an established authority did not exist It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece In China philosophical anarchism ie t
r surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations see graph At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this At small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivityvsincidentangle curve and a locally increased average incident angle Although the reflectivity of water is very low 
he few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing However sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker who opposed age of consent laws believing they would benefit predatory men A historical current that arose and flourished during and within anarchism was free love In contemporary anarchism this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism Free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as a wa

autism as a culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements Many autistic individuals have been successful in their fields Autism rights movement The autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic beh

the jealousy that arose from free love Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage prochoice utilising a contemporary term and had a similar agenda Anarchist and nonanarchist feminists differed on suffrage but they were nonetheless supportive of one another During the second half of the th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well By the latest decades of the th century ana
