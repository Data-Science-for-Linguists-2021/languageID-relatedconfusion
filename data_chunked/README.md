The data as distributed in this repository is modified from its original form. 248 languages' Wikipedias are each represented by its own file in this directory. For each language, after removing punctuation and other non-language characters, up to 10000 randomly selected 500-character "chunks", or segments of text, have been psuedorandomly selected from that language's wikipedia, then psuedorandomly shuffled. As such, the data presented here is no substitute for the original work.
