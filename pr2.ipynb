However, I now have the full dataset and can explore some statistics on that a little. I'll also walk through how I set up the networking stuff."

Although scp is faster, I chose sftp since `paramiko` has support for passing the remote computer's password as an argument, rather than forcing a human to be there to type in the password every time. Instead, my code is set up so that the password is gathered securely, one time at the very start of the script, and stored for repeated use.\n",
